# NI-VSM

My work on NI-VSM in semester B202 at [FIT CTU](https://fit.cvut.cz/en).

## TL;DR

It ain't much, but it's honest work. :thumbsup:

## [Homework](homework)

## [Exam preparation](exam)

I also contributed to [pokorj54/VSM-notebooks](https://github.com/pokorj54/VSM-notebooks). Look at this source for better-formated and more comprehensive materials.
